                Harry had a thin face, knobbly knees, black hair and bright-green eyes. He wore round glasses held together with a lot of Sellotape because of all the times Dudley had punched him on the nose. The only thing Harry liked about his own appearance was a very thin scar on his forehead which was shaped like a bolt of lightning. He had had it as long as he could remember and the first question he could ever remember asking his Aunt Petunia was how he had got it.

                Daniel Radcliffe certainly looks the part of Harry – with one minor exception. His Harry has blue eyes, while the books tell us time and time again of Harry’s green eyes – just like his mother’s. There’s a pretty simple reason for this, though. Radcliffe, who has blue eyes, couldn’t wear green contact lenses, as he was allergic.

                She had a bossy sort of voice, lots of bushy brown hair and rather large front teeth.
                Harry Potter and the Philosopher’s Stone. Before getting her teeth shortened by Madam Pomfrey and discovering Sleekeazy’s Hair Potion, Hermione was known in the earlier Harry Potter books for having bushy hair and big teeth.

                In the films, Emma Watson’s Hermione has a slightly different spin: her hair is more wavy than bushy, and her teeth are normal-sized – for the most part. Christopher Columbus and Watson did indeed try out fake teeth in the first film, but the director quickly realised this was impractical.
